The dataset includes 4641 images.
Plant-disease are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -30 and +30 degrees
